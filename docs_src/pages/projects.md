Einops tutorials cover multiple einops usages (and you'd better first follow tutorials), 
but it can also help to see einops in action.


## Selected projects

Here are some open-source projects that can teach how to leverage einops for your problems


- [@lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains) has a dramatic [collection of vision transformers](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch)
    - there is a plenty of good examples how to use einops efficiently in your projects


- lambda networks (non-conventional architecture) implemented by @lucidrains
    - nice demonstration how clearer code can be with einops, even compared to description in the paper 
    - [implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/lambda-networks) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qxJ2WD8p4w)


- capsule networks (aka capsnets) [implemented in einops](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/readable_capsnet)
    - blazingly fast, concise (3-10 times less code), and memory efficient capsule networks, written with einops  


- [NuX](https://github.com/Information-Fusion-Lab-Umass/NuX) â€” normalizing flows in Jax
    - different rearrangement patterns in normalizing flows have nice mapping to einops


- For video recognition, look at [MotionFormer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Motionformer) 
  and [TimeSFormer](https://github.com/lucidrains/TimeSformer-pytorch) implementations


- For protein folding, see [implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/invariant-point-attention)
  of invariant point attention from AlphaFold 2
