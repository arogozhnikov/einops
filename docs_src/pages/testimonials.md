Einops was created three years ago, and never hit big ML news.
However, little by little and step by step it sneaked into every major AI lab.

This all happened by word of mouth and by sharing code snippets:


> Einops simplifies and clarifies array/tensor manipulation. 👍 <br />
> You really have to try it out, you'll love it: https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops <br />
> Plus it supports NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.

> This is your daily reminder to *never* trust pytorch's native reshape/view. <br /> 
> Always use einops! 
> 
> (Just spend 1 h debugging code and it turned out tensor.view was shuffling the tensor in a weird way)

> TIL einops can be faster than raw PyTorch 🤯

@PyTorch by default.

> Yes, I am also using einops in that snippet! It's great! <br /> 
> I wished I knew about it from the start when it was created

> A little late to the party, but einops (https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops) is a massive improvement to deep learning code readability. I love this!

Comment: some of 'late to the party' tweets are 2 years old now. You can never be late to this party.



> I recently discovered the beauty of torch.einsum and einops.rearrange <br /> 
> and at this point I'm confused why I even bothered with other tensor operations in the first place.
