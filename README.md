## Installation  <a name="Installation"></a>

Plain and simple:
```bash
pip install einops
```

<!--
`einops` has no mandatory dependencies (code examples also require jupyter, pillow + backends). 
To obtain the latest github version 

```bash
pip install https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops/archive/master.zip
```
-->

## Tutorials <a name="Tutorials"></a>

Tutorials are the most convenient way to see `einops` in action

- part 1: [einops fundamentals](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops/blob/master/docs/1-einops-basics.ipynb) 
- part 2: [einops for deep learning](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops/blob/master/docs/2-einops-for-deep-learning.ipynb)
- part 3: [improve pytorch code with einops](https://arogozhnikov.github.io/einops/pytorch-examples.html)   


## API <a name="API"></a>

`einops` has a minimalistic yet powerful API.

Three operations provided ([einops tutorial](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops/blob/master/docs/) 
shows those cover stacking, reshape, transposition, squeeze/unsqueeze, repeat, tile, concatenate, view and numerous reductions)

```python
from einops import rearrange, reduce, repeat
# rearrange elements according to the pattern
output_tensor = rearrange(input_tensor, 't b c -> b c t')
# combine rearrangement and reduction
output_tensor = reduce(input_tensor, 'b c (h h2) (w w2) -> b h w c', 'mean', h2=2, w2=2)
# copy along a new axis 
output_tensor = repeat(input_tensor, 'h w -> h w c', c=3)
```
And two corresponding layers (`einops` keeps a separate version for each framework) with the same API.

```python
from einops.layers.chainer import Rearrange, Reduce
from einops.layers.gluon import Rearrange, Reduce
from einops.layers.keras import Rearrange, Reduce
from einops.layers.torch import Rearrange, Reduce
from einops.layers.tensorflow import Rearrange, Reduce
```

Layers behave similarly to operations and have the same parameters 
(with the exception of the first argument, which is passed during call)

```python
layer = Rearrange(pattern, **axes_lengths)
layer = Reduce(pattern, reduction, **axes_lengths)

# apply created layer to a tensor / variable
x = layer(x)
```

Example of using layers within a model:
```python
# example given for pytorch, but code in other frameworks is almost identical  
from torch.nn import Sequential, Conv2d, MaxPool2d, Linear, ReLU
from einops.layers.torch import Rearrange

model = Sequential(
    Conv2d(3, 6, kernel_size=5),
    MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2),
    Conv2d(6, 16, kernel_size=5),
    MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2),
    # flattening
    Rearrange('b c h w -> b (c h w)'),  
    Linear(16*5*5, 120), 
    ReLU(),
    Linear(120, 10), 
)
```

<!---
Additionally two auxiliary functions provided
```python
from einops import asnumpy, parse_shape
# einops.asnumpy converts tensors of imperative frameworks to numpy
numpy_tensor = asnumpy(input_tensor)
# einops.parse_shape gives a shape of axes of interest 
parse_shape(input_tensor, 'batch _ h w') # e.g {'batch': 64, 'h': 128, 'w': 160}
```
-->

## Naming <a name="Naming"></a>

`einops` stands for Einstein-Inspired Notation for operations 
(though "Einstein operations" is more attractive and easier to remember).

Notation was loosely inspired by Einstein summation (in particular by `numpy.einsum` operation).

## Why use `einops` notation?! <a name="Why-using-einops-notation"></a>


### Semantic information (being verbose in expectations)

```python
y = x.view(x.shape[0], -1)
y = rearrange(x, 'b c h w -> b (c h w)')
```
While these two lines are doing the same job in *some* context,
the second one provides information about the input and output.
In other words, `einops` focuses on interface: *what is the input and output*, not *how* the output is computed.

The next operation looks similar:

```python
y = rearrange(x, 'time c h w -> time (c h w)')
```
but it gives the reader a hint: 
this is not an independent batch of images we are processing, 
but rather a sequence (video). 

Semantic information makes the code easier to read and maintain. 

### Convenient checks

Reconsider the same example:

```python
y = x.view(x.shape[0], -1) # x: (batch, 256, 19, 19)
y = rearrange(x, 'b c h w -> b (c h w)')
```
The second line checks that the input has four dimensions, 
but you can also specify particular dimensions. 
That's opposed to just writing comments about shapes since 
[comments don't work and don't prevent mistakes](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/code-comments-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-be9cc65fbf83)
as we know   
```python
y = x.view(x.shape[0], -1) # x: (batch, 256, 19, 19)
y = rearrange(x, 'b c h w -> b (c h w)', c=256, h=19, w=19)
```

### Result is strictly determined

Below we have at least two ways to define the depth-to-space operation
```python
# depth-to-space
rearrange(x, 'b c (h h2) (w w2) -> b (c h2 w2) h w', h2=2, w2=2)
rearrange(x, 'b c (h h2) (w w2) -> b (h2 w2 c) h w', h2=2, w2=2)
```
There are at least four more ways to do it. Which one is used by the framework?

These details are ignored, since *usually* it makes no difference, 
but it can make a big difference (e.g. if you use grouped convolutions in the next stage), 
and you'd like to specify this in your code.


### Uniformity

```python
reduce(x, 'b c (x dx) -> b c x', 'max', dx=2)
reduce(x, 'b c (x dx) (y dy) -> b c x y', 'max', dx=2, dy=3)
reduce(x, 'b c (x dx) (y dy) (z dz) -> b c x y z', 'max', dx=2, dy=3, dz=4)
```
These examples demonstrated that we don't use separate operations for 1d/2d/3d pooling, 
those are all defined in a uniform way. 

Space-to-depth and depth-to space are defined in many frameworks but how about width-to-height? Here you go:

```python
rearrange(x, 'b c h (w w2) -> b c (h w2) w', w2=2)
```

### Framework independent behavior

Even simple functions are defined differently by different frameworks

```python
y = x.flatten() # or flatten(x)
```

Suppose `x`'s shape was `(3, 4, 5)`, then `y` has shape ...

- numpy, cupy, chainer, pytorch: `(60,)`
- keras, tensorflow.layers, mxnet and gluon: `(3, 20)`

`einops` works the same way in all frameworks.

### Independence of framework terminology

Example: `tile` vs `repeat` causes lots of confusion. To copy image along width:
```python
np.tile(image, (1, 2))    # in numpy
image.repeat(1, 2)        # pytorch's repeat ~ numpy's tile
```

With einops you don't need to decipher which axis was repeated:
```python
repeat(image, 'h w -> h (tile w)', tile=2)  # in numpy
repeat(image, 'h w -> h (tile w)', tile=2)  # in pytorch
repeat(image, 'h w -> h (tile w)', tile=2)  # in tf
repeat(image, 'h w -> h (tile w)', tile=2)  # in jax
repeat(image, 'h w -> h (tile w)', tile=2)  # in mxnet
... (etc.)
```
